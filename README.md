# ild-archive
 An archive of .ild files I found on the interweb. These can be imported to LaserOS for your LaserDock/LaserCube.
 
 I compiled my favorites (Geometric, Animations, and Beam Shows) into `laser-animations.zip` so you can download it an extract on your device for easy import to LaserOS.
